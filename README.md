Using Excel, I’ve learned to import and manipulate data from CSV files.
One of the standout tools I’ve explored is Power Query, which has revolutionized how I clean and transform raw data into structured, usable formats. 
It was fascinating to work through real-world challenges, like handling missing data, correcting errors, and reformatting datasets to make them analysis-ready. 
These experiences have strengthened my problem-solving abilities and taught me the importance of meticulous attention to detail when working with data.

My most recent project involved creating a dashboard that visualizes and communicates complex data in an intuitive way. 
This dashboard not only represents numbers but also tells a compelling story about key business trends. Here's a glimpse of some valuable insights I discovered:

📊 Order vs Sales Trends: My analysis showed a clear pattern of seasonal sales activity. 
Sales peaked in January, signaling a strong start to the year, while December exhibited a noticeable dip, hinting at potential areas for strategy improvement.

👩‍🦰 Customer Demographics: It was interesting to find that 64% of customers were women, with teenagers making up the largest age group. These insights can inform targeted marketing strategies.

🚚 Order Status: A remarkable 92% of orders were successfully delivered, with only a small fraction involving cancellations or refunds. This reflects the efficiency of the logistics process.

📍 Top Performing States: Maharashtra emerged as the leader in sales, followed by Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh. 
This regional data offers valuable input for optimizing resource allocation and outreach efforts.
🛒 Order Channels: Flipkart stood out as the top-performing sales channel, contributing an impressive 35% of total orders, showcasing its significance in the sales mix.

This project taught me the value of data visualization in making numbers meaningful and actionable. 
Through this dashboard, I could communicate insights that can drive strategic decisions and highlight opportunities for improvement.

These new skills have fueled my passion for data analytics even further. 
I’m amazed at how powerful tools like Excel and Power Query can be when combined with the right techniques and creative thinking. 
This experience has reinforced my belief in the importance of continuous learning and growth.
